### 5) Configure the Path to the JSON File  

The project relies on a JSON file containing position data. You must ensure that the file path is correctly set in the `MetricsCalculatorTest` class. This path will vary based on where you store the JSON file on your local system. Here's how to set it:  

1. Locate the JSON file in the `Supportive Files` folder.  
2. Note the full path to the JSON file on your system. For example:  
   - Windows: `C:/Users/YourName/FolderPath/tech-challenge-2024-positions.json`  
   - macOS/Linux: `/Users/YourName/FolderPath/tech-challenge-2024-positions.json`  
3. Open the `MetricsCalculatorTest.java` file in your IDE.  
4. Find the line containing the `filePath` variable:  
   ```java  
   String filePath = "C:/Users/koste/Desktop/My FolderS/JobFolder/IT JobS/PerFormatiV-Job/tech-challenge-2024-positions.json";
